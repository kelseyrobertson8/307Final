		<h3>  How to Help</h3>
		<h4> Get Involved</h4>
		
		<p> There are many benefits to volunteering. Volunteering gives people the opportunity to make a difference and give back to the community around them. Volunteering can also help the enviornment or help the less fortunate. Those who volunteer also report having increased self-esteem and confidence, as well as feeling like a valued part of a team. <br>
		 Volunteering can also be a chance to try something new, and perhaps find a new passion. For some, this could lead to a career change. In this situation, volunteering can be a way to gain new skills, knowledge, and experiences. Volunteering can also help strengthen existing skills. Being able to use one's professional skills and knowledge to benefit others is a major benefit of volunteering.
		<br>
		Some people are also drawn to volunteering for the social benefits. These include meeting new people, getting to know the local community, and getting a change to socialize. No matter what motivates you to volunteer, it is important to find something you are passionate about!
